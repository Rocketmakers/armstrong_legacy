    Rockets are relatively lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining <code>extremely high speeds</code> with reasonable efficiency. Rockets are not reliant on the atmosphere and work very well in space.

    A rocket (Italian rocchetta, Spindle)<sup>[1]</sup> is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction. Rocket engines push rockets forward by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed. Rockets <code>rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines,</code> gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, and/or gravity to help control flight.

<h3>History of rockets</h3>
<p>
    Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century China.<sup>[3]</sup> Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the moon. Rockets are now used for fireworks, weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration.
</p>
<h3>Modern beginnings</h3>
<p>
    Rocket technology was first known to Europeans following its use by the Mongols Genghis Khan and Ogedei Khan when they conquered parts of Russia, Eastern, and Central Europe<sup>[2]</sup>. The Mongolians had acquired the Chinese technology by conquest of the northern part of China and by the subsequent employment of Chinese rocketry experts as mercenaries for the Mongol military. Reports of the Battle of Mohi in the year 1241 describe the use of rocket-like weapons by the Mongols against the Magyars.
